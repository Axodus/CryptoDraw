The prize distribution mechanism in the `CryptoDraw` contract is designed to allocate the prize pool and agent commissions based on predefined percentages. Here's a detailed breakdown of how prizes are calculated:

### Prize Calculation Process

1. **Prize Pool Contribution**:
   - Each ticket purchased contributes to the `prizePool`. The total `prizePool` accumulates from all ticket sales until the next draw occurs.

2. **Draw Execution**:
   - When a draw is executed (either manually or by Chainlink Keepers), random numbers are generated by Chainlink VRF, and the winning numbers are determined.

3. **Prize Distribution**:
   - **Gross Prize Distribution**:
     - **Gross Prize Pool**: This is a portion of the `prizePool` that is set aside for prize money.
     - **Percentage**: 43.35% of the `prizePool` is allocated to the gross prize pool.
     - **Calculation**: `grossPrize = (prizePool * 4335) / 10000`

   - **Agent Commissions Distribution**:
     - **Agent Commissions Pool**: This is a portion of the `prizePool` allocated to agent commissions.
     - **Percentage**: 8.61% of the `prizePool` is set aside for agent commissions.
     - **Calculation**: `agentsCommissionTotal = (prizePool * 861) / 10000`
   
4. **Agent Commission Payout**:
   - **Distribution**:
     - Each agent's commission is paid out based on the number of tickets sold by that agent.
     - The commission is directly transferred to the agent’s address from the `prizePool`.
   - **Commission Reset**: After payout, each agent’s commission balance is reset to zero.

5. **Prize Pool Reset**:
   - After all agent commissions are paid out and the prize distribution is executed, the `prizePool` is reset to zero.

6. **Prize Claiming**:
   - Players can claim their winnings based on their match count with the winning numbers. The exact method for calculating player prizes is not detailed in the provided code but generally involves matching player numbers with winning numbers.

### Summary of Distribution Calculation

- **Gross Prize Money**: 43.35% of the `prizePool`
- **Agent Commissions**: 8.61% of the `prizePool`

### Key Contract Functions Related to Prize Calculation

**`distributePrizes()`**:
   - Responsible for calculating and distributing the prize money and agent commissions based on the percentages defined.
   - Resets the `prizePool` after distribution.

**`fulfillRandomWords(uint256, uint256[] memory _randomWords)`**:
   - Called by Chainlink VRF Coordinator when random numbers are ready. The winning numbers are generated from the random words.

### Additional Details

- The actual allocation of player prizes is not explicitly detailed in the `distributePrizes()` function in the provided code. Typically, player prizes are determined based on the number of matching numbers between the player's ticket and the winning numbers, but this logic would need to be implemented or referenced from the complete contract.

- Ensure that all percentages and distributions comply with the intended business rules and legal requirements for lottery or raffle systems in the relevant jurisdiction.
